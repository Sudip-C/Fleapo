              <p class="paragraph" id="text1" >
                There has long been speculation about the impact that sleeping on a
                quality pillow and seeing your dreams have on each other. Some
                people believe that when you sleep on good pillows, it allows dream
                energy to flow freely, allowing for clearer and more vivid dreams.
                Others maintain that a good night's sleep is simply not possible
                without a comfortable and supportive pillow setting up the right
                environment. Whatever your opinion, it's hard to deny that the
                connection between dreaming and pillows should not be overlooked.
                After all, no matter what kind of mattress you may use, if your head
                isn't comfortably supported by a good pillow at night – then restful
                sleep and in-depth dreams will naturally suffer. So next time you're
                in search of better quality bed linen, don't forget to invest in
                some solid pillows too – they could just be the key to sweet
                dreamland!
